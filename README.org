#+TITLE: hs-conllu

  this package provides a validating parser of the [[http://universaldependencies.org/format.html][CoNLL-U format]],
  along with a data model for its constituents.

  further processing utilities are being developed, and currently
  include tree building and processing functions, relation extraction,
  and tree linearization.

** Installation
   #+BEGIN_SRC term
   cd /path/of/choice/
   git clone $REPO_URL
   #+END_SRC
   - using =cabal=:
     #+BEGIN_SRC term
     cabal install
     #+END_SRC
   - using =stack=:
     #+BEGIN_SRC term
     stack setup
     stack build
     #+END_SRC

   if you have problems with the dependency versions, you may try to
   alter them in the cabal file for the version you have. the version
   bounds were generated automatically by cabal, and are probably
   conservative -- the library probably will probably still work if
   you have the same major version. (if it does, make a PR!)

   if you don't want to have this kind of problem anymore, try [[https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/][stack]]
   (see why [[https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2015/06/why-is-stack-not-cabal][here]]).
