- library:
  - Convert String -> Text
  - use quickcheck for property testing
  
- Type:
  - should I remove Maybe's where I can ([] as Nothing)?
  - should have one data declaration for each kin of token?

- Parse:
  - warn of spaces in fields where they are not allowed (FORM and
    LEMMA). do this in symbol function.
  - check what's the purpose of the '_' in this MISC field:
    '_|SpaceAfter=Yes'. should it be allowed?
  - create non validating parser: count 10 (stringNot "\t\n" <* tab)

- Data:
  - add token functions or let user do it?
